# CustomerChurn
##Abstract
The objective of this AI project is to develop a model for predicting customer churn in the
telecommunications industry. Customer churn is a major concern for telco companies as losing customers
impacts revenue and growth. In this project, machine learning algorithms will be employed to analyze
customer data and identify patterns that can be used to predict churn.
The project will begin with data collection and pre-processing, where relevant customer data such as
demographics, service usage, and payment history will be gathered and cleaned. Feature engineering
techniques will then be applied to extract meaningful features from the data. Several machine learning
models such as logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting will be trained and evaluated
using different performance metrics.
The model with the best performance will be deployed into a user-friendly web application to enable
real-time predictions and recommendations. The application will provide valuable insights into customer
behavior and enable proactive measures to be taken to prevent churn. This project will provide a
powerful tool for telco companies to enhance customer retention and improve business growth.
